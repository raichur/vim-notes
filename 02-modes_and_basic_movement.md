# Vim Modes

Unlike in Atom or Sublime Text, Vim has two modes:
- Command Mode: This is where you type commands that alter the text. This is the default mode.
- Insert Mode: This is where you type text.

# Switching between modes

To access the insert mode, simply type the letter ``i``.

To leave the insert mode, just press ``esc``.

# Saving files

To save a file in vim, type ``:write WELCOME.txt`` (WELCOME.txt being an example, of course).

# Quitting Vim

To quit Vim, type ``:q`` after saving. Use the command ``:wq`` to save and quit at once.

# Basic Movement

The h, j, k, and l keys are used to navigate the Vim document. This makes it easier to navigate (less finger movement) compared to using the arrow keys.

``h``: left
``j``: down
``k``: up
``l``: right
