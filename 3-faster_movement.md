# Commands for Faster Movement

We already know how to navigate the document using the h, j, k, and l keys, but what if we wanted to navigate faster?

- The ``w`` key allows you to go one word forward.
- The ``b`` key allows you to go one word backward.
- The ``W`` key allows you to go to the next string separated by a “ ”.
- The ``$`` key takes you to the beginning of the line.
- The ``^`` key takes you to the end of the line.
