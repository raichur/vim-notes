# Windows and Tabs

You can split windows horizontally and vertically. You can have as many splits as you like.

Type ``:vsplit <path of file>`` to split the window in half vertically.
Type ``hsplit <path of file>`` to split the window in half horizontally. 

You can navigate between the windows using the ``Ctrl+w`` sequence, followed by one of the movement keys (h, j, k, l).
