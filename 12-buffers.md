# Buffers

Buffers are special places in memory that store information about the files we have open.

You can view all of the files in buffer by typing ``:ls``. You can navigate through them by typing ``:bnext`` and ``:bp``. ``:b#`` will go to the last file in buffer you visited.

``:bd`` can delete the current buffer.
