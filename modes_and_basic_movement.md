# Vim Modes

Unlike in Atom or Sublime Text, Vim has two modes:
- Command Mode: This is where you type commands that alter the text. This is the default mode.
- Insert Mode: This is where you type text.

# Switching between modes

To access the insert mode, simply type the letter ``i``.

To leave the insert mode, just press ``esc``.

# Saving files

To save a file in vim, type ``:write WELCOME.txt`` (WELCOME.txt being an example, of course).
